<h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>My name is Billy. I'm a technologist that works on open learning environments.</p>
	<img src="../img/billy_armory_max.jpg">

<p><i>If you're reading this page, you probably want to know more about me.</i></p>

<p>I work for the <a href="https://dcdc.coe.hawaii.edu/">Distance Course Design and Consulting (DCDC) Group</a> in the College of Education at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I've had a hand in many educational technology initiatives over the last several years, focusing on projects that support open, distributed learning. These days I plan and design higher education courses and programs, build bicycles, surf some, and tinker with Web technology that supports learning and creativity.</p>

<p>I facilitate workshops and speak at conferences, and occasionally take on creative projects. If you're interested in getting in touch with me about an opportunity, head over to the <a href="http://billymeinke.com/contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
