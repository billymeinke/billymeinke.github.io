  <h2> Instructional Support Group (ISG) Metrics</h2>
  <h3>Support Request Tickets</h3>
  <p>This interactive display shows the number of support ticket requests handled by ISG since the standing-up of a ticket system for all College of Education technology requests. <i>Select (click and drag) an area of the lower graph, and the upper graph will focus to the narrower time frame</i>.</p>
</p>The graph is an adaptation of a <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1667367">Focus+Context via Brushing</a> block by mbostock on bl.ocks.org. It utilizes d3.js. run right here on this site.</p>

<h3>Workshop Dates and Participant Volume</h3>
<p>This heat map represents workshops delivered by ISG since 2008, by day of the week and month/year. <i>Darker spots indicate higher numbers of participants in each training</i>.</p>
	<p>The graph is similar to the contribution heat map found on Github user profile pages, and code was borrowed from <a href="https://github.com/gyaikhom/activitymap">gyaikhom's activitymap</a>.</p>
