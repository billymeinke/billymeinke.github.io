This is the personal website of Billy Meinke. This site is a mashering of two Bootstrap-based Jekyll themes, with a main landing page and a blog within. It was based on the following:

#### [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/)
* [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/)
* [Clean blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll)

Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by **David Miller**, Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](http://www.ironsummitmedia.com/). Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.twitter.com/fat). Start Boostrap themes are Copyright 2014 Iron Summit Media Strategies, LLC.
